## 🏗️ Architecture Overview
This architecture is designed following the **AWS Well-Architected Framework** pillars:  
**Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.**

It ensures that the application is:  
- **Highly Available** (using Multi-AZ setup).  
- **Scalable** (via Auto Scaling Groups).  
- **Secure** (with public and private subnets separation).  
- **Cost-optimized** (using NAT Gateway and managed services).

## 🔹 Components

### 👤 User
- End users interact with the application through a web or mobile client.  
- Requests are routed via DNS to AWS infrastructure.  

### 🌐 Amazon Route 53
- Manages DNS and directs traffic to the **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.  
- Supports latency-based routing and health checks for reliability.  

### ⚖️ Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.  
- Ensures fault tolerance and improves scalability.  
- Placed inside **public subnets** within the VPC.  

### 🏢 Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
- Provides network isolation and segmentation.  
- Configured across **two Availability Zones (AZs)** for high availability.  
- Each AZ includes:
  - **Public Subnet** → Hosts ALB and a NAT Gateway.  
  - **Private Subnet** → Hosts EC2 instances (application servers).  

### 💻 Amazon EC2 (Auto Scaling Group)
- EC2 instances run the application backend.  
- **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** ensures the number of instances increases/decreases based on demand.  
- Deployed across private subnets in multiple AZs.  

### 🗄️ Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
- Provides a **Multi-AZ database** deployment for durability and availability.  
- Only accessible from the private subnets (not exposed to the internet).  
- Ensures automatic failover and backups.  

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- **Scalability**: Auto Scaling adapts to traffic fluctuations.  
- **High Availability**: Multi-AZ deployment ensures uptime even if one AZ fails.  
- **Security**: Public and private subnet separation, security groups, and NAT Gateway for outbound internet access.  
- **Resilience**: Load balancing + health checks ensure fault tolerance.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverages managed AWS services to reduce operational overhead.

## ✅ Conclusion
This architecture provides a **robust, secure, and scalable foundation** for deploying modern web applications on AWS.  
By following the **Well-Architected Framework**, it ensures the system is reliable, efficient, and future-proof for growing workloads.
